Tor Browser Launcher is intended to make the Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) easier to
maintain and use for GNU/Linux users. You install 'torbrowser-launcher' from
your distribution's package manager and it handles everything else, including:

* Downloading the most recent version of TBB for you, in your language and for
  your architecture
* Automatically updating (while preserving your bookmarks and preferences)
* Verifying the TBB's GnuPG signature
* Adding a "Tor Browser" application launcher to your desktop environment's menu

This patched firefox/torbrowser build is _NOT_ recommended by Tor upstream but
uses the exact same sources. Use this only if you know what you are doing!

The profile folder includes pre-configuration recommended by upstream,
as well as the extensions Torbutton, NoScript and HTTPS-Everywhere.
If you want to start from scratch just remove the directory '~/.mozilla/torbrowser'.

Torbrowser uses port 9150 to connect to Tor. You can change the port
in the connection settings to match your setup.
